# ParentFinder
Find the closest common parent between two nodes

On startup the program generates a random queue that goes from nodes 1-15 and displays 
the binary tree of the queue on the screen. The user will be prompted for input. 
Input of non-numbers, or numbers non-existant in the tree may crash the program.
