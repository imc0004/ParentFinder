# ParentFinder
Find the closest common parent between two nodes

On startup the program generates a random queue that goes from nodes 1-15 and displays 
the binary tree of the queue on the screen. The user will be prompted for input. 
Input of non-numbers, or numbers non-existant in the tree may crash the program. 

Note: if one of the nodes selected by user is the direct parent of another node selected by user then 
that parent node that is also selected by user will be painted yellow to designate it is the closest parent
shared by both. Therefore, there will only be two nodes lit up instead of three in this case.
